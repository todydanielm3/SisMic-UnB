Addicore also has resistors of all sizes.
Theory:
-------
The HC-SR04 works by sending an ultrasonic pulse and then sensing it as it
returns.  With a microcontroller (and the use of the pulseIn function)
it is possible to measure the time the pulse took to travel out, reflect
off an object, and return.  Knowing the speed of sound the distance
to the object can be calculated.
The HC-SR04 needs 5V at Vcc but the digital (Trig) will go high
if it receives 3V3 from a LaunchPad.  However, it sends 5V back (Echo) and
level conversion is required or a LaunchPad pin could be fried.  An
inexpensive way to do one way level conversion of this sort is with
resistors in a voltage divider as shown in the circuit below.
This code should also work with an Arduino Uno but leave the voltage
divider out of the circuit since it is a 5V device also.

  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);            // send low to get a clean pulse
  delayMicroseconds(5);                  // let it settle
  digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);           // send high to trigger device
  delayMicroseconds(10);                 // let it settle

  pulseLength = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);  // measure pulse coming back

  // Sound travels about 1130 feet/sec at sea level and normal conditions
  // or 13,560 inches/sec.  The pulseIn function is in micro seconds
  // so the speed would then be 0.01356 in / ms.

  // Use float if the precision is needed but this example will use integer
  // math for speed.  Then, 1/.001356 = 73.75,  or approx. 74 ms/in.  Since
  // the signal is travelling out and back, we want half the time for
  // distance.  Therefore divide by 2 and then 74 ms/in (which is divide
  // by 148).  Want centimeters?  The devisor is 58.

  inches = pulseLength / 148;
  centimeters = pulseLength / 58;
